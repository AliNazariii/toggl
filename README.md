## Toggl Client

Toggl is a time tracker developed with TypeScript and ReactJS.<br>
You can start time entries with toggl and track or manage them.<br>
Notice: This is a mobile-based client and connected to my real [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) account through [Toggl API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs).<br>
I had developed this project when I wanted to start learning TypeScript and Redux.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
